##### IMPORTANT
## avoid spaces in the description of the identities: 
## like this "cmd = my commad"
## instead use in this form "cmd=my commad"

### number of threads available to run the files
### don't put more than the processors available in your machine
## IMPORTANT, the command line can have threadings to, so need to limit the number of threadings here.

## extensions to look. It can be empty. If empty look for the regular fastq files out by illumina
## You can put value only on "extension_1=" like ".txt". It's going to process all the files ended with ".txt" and the file names are going to appear in FILE1 variable
## You you want to activate both variables, FILE1 and FILE2, you can put like:
##  "extension_1=_1P.fastq" and "extension_2=_2P.fastq" 
extension_1=_bqsr.bam
extension_2=


### If true need human confirmation after collecting all the data
### Set this to false if is used in a pipeline
confirm_after_collect_data=true

### global path where the data is going to be saved

### if all fasta/fastq files are expecting to be paired
##
expecting_all_paired_files=false

### command line with variables
##
##  	'cmd' can have three variations, first run cmd, then cmd_one_file and for last cmd_two_files
##		At least one 'cmd' need to have something to run.
##			1) cmd -> is a regular command, it's going to run with one or two 'fasta/fastq' files
##			2) cmd_one_file -> only run when has one 'fasta/fastq' file
##			3) cmd_two_files -> only run when has two 'fasta/fastq' files
##
## 		VARIABLES
##		1)	FILE1					-> reads_R1.fastq.gz/reads_R1.fastq/reads_R1.fasta.gz/reads_R1.fasta 
##		2)	FILE2					-> reads_R2.fastq.gz/reads_R2.fastq/reads_R2.fasta.gz/reads_R2.fasta


##		1)	FILE1_CHANGED			-> GSE96700_GSM2538511/reads_R1.fastq.gz  ->  GSE96700_GSM2538511/GSE96700_GSM2538511_R1.fastq.gz 
##		2)	FILE2_CHANGED			-> GSE96700_GSM2538511/reads_R2.fastq.gz  ->  GSE96700_GSM2538511/GSE96700_GSM2538511_R2.fastq.gz

##
##		OR		If not identify any _R1.<extension> in directory start looking for files ended with (fastq.gz, fastq, fasta.gz or fasta)
##
##		1)  FILE1					-> reads.fastq.gz/reads.fastq/reads.fasta.gz/reads.fasta
##
##		3)	PREFIX_FILES_OUT		-> reads
##		4)	OUT_FOLDER				-> outData/reads/....

##		TEMP variables				-> you can create temporary files as you want
##   								-> only need to start with "TEMPORARY_" word. It is going to create a file where the data is going to be saved. 
									-> at the end it's is going to be remove automatically
