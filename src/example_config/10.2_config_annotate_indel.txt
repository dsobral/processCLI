##### IMPORTANT
## avoid spaces in the description of the identities: 
## like this "cmd = my commad"
## instead use in this form "cmd=my commad"

####

### number of threads available to run the files
### don't put more than the processors available in your machine
## IMPORTANT, the command line can have threadings to, so need to limit the number of threadings here.
processors=8

#######################
### if you want to run all in SGE enviroment set a queue name, like -ibimed-single.q-
#queue_name=ibimed-single.q
## default cores to run in cluster, if more than 1 activate "#$ -pe smp <cores requested>", ibimed-nodes.q
## The queue must be configured with "smp", like "pe_list     make smp"
#SGE_cores_requested=4

#######################
## extensions to look. It can be empty. If empty look for the regular fastq files out by illumina
## You can put value only on "extension_1=" like ".txt". It's going to process all the files ended with ".txt" and the file names are going to appear in FILE1 variable
## You you want to activate both variables, FILE1 and FILE2, you can put like:
##  "extension_1=_1P.fastq" and "extension_2=_2P.fastq" 
extension_1=indels.PASS.vcf.gz
extension_2=


## If the file/s are inside a folder data/GSE96700_GSM2538511/Neocortex_Diestrus2.fa.gz
##	the name is going to be replaced by  '<output_path>/GSE96700_GSM2538511/GSE96700_GSM2538511.fa.gz
###  replace files names by folder name
###  default is FALSE
replace_file_name_by_folder_name=False

### If true need human confirmation after collecting all the data
### Set this to false if is used in a pipeline
confirm_after_collect_data=yes


### global path where the data is going to be saved
output_path=10_annot_indel

### if all fasta/fastq files are expecting to be paired
##
expecting_all_paired_files=no

###Log file, where the progression of process are going o be saved
log_file=base_validation.log

### command line with variables
##
##  	'cmd' can have three variations, first run cmd, then cmd_one_file and for last cmd_two_files
##		At least one 'cmd' need to have something to run.OUT_FOLDER/PREFIX_FILES_OUT.vcf
##			1) cmd -> is a regular command, it's going to run with one or two 'fasta/fastq' files
##			2) cmd_one_file -> only run when has one 'fasta/fastq' file
##			3) cmd_two_files -> only run when has two 'fasta/fastq' files
##
## 		VARIABLES
##		1)	FILE1					-> reads_1P_trim.fastq.gz/reads_1P_trim.fastq/reads_1P_trim.fasta.gz/reads_1P_trim.fasta 
##		2)	FILE2					-> reads_2P_trim.fastq.gz/reads_2P_trim.fastq/reads_2P_trim.fasta.gz/reads_2P_trim.fasta
